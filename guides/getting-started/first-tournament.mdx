# First Tournament in 10 Minutes

You don't need to write a single line of code to run your first tournament. This guide walks you through the **Console** workflow.

## Prerequisites
- Access to `https://console.16tms.com`

## Steps

1.  **Create a Game**:
    - Go to **Games** > **Add Game**.
    - Enter "Demo Game".

2.  **Create Currency** (Optional but recommended):
    - Go to **Finance** > **Add Currency**.
    - Create "USD" or "Points".

3.  **Create Tournament**:
    - Go to **Tournaments** > **Create**.
    - Select your "Demo Game".
    - Choose **Single Elimination**.
    - Set start time to 15 minutes from now.
    - Publish!

4.  **Add Participants**:
    - Since we aren't integrated yet, use the **Import** feature or manually add dummy teams in the **Participants** tab.

5.  **Start & Manage**:
    - Once the start time hits, the bracket generates.
    - Go to **Brackets** to advance teams manually.
