# API Key Generation

To interact with the 16TMS API, you need an API Key.

## Generating a Key

1.  Log in to the **16TMS Console**.
2.  Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
3.  Click **Generate New Key**.
4.  Copy the key immediately. You will not be able to see it again.

## Authentication

Pass this key in the header of your requests:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
