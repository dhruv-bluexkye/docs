# User Login Flow

Since 16TMS is a white-label solution, we don't manage user passwords. We map your users to our system via your internal ID.

## Steps

1.  **User logs in** to your app.
2.  **Your Backend** calls `POST /v1/auth/login` with:
    - `external_id`: Your unique user ID.
    - `username`: Display name.
    - `avatar`: URL to avatar.
3.  **16TMS** responds with a `session_token`.
4.  **Client** uses this token for subsequent requests (joining tournaments, etc.).
