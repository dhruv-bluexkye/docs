The Bracket Viewer allows you to display real-time tournament brackets within your application or website.

## Overview

The bracket viewer is a web-based component that visualizes the progression of a tournament. It is specifically designed for **Duel (1v1) Tournaments**.

## Usage

To integrate the bracket viewer, you can embed it using an `iframe` or a `WebView` (for mobile applications).

### URL Structure

The URL for the bracket viewer follows this pattern:

```
https://brackets.16tms.com/{tournament_id}
```

Replace `{tournament_id}` with the unique identifier of the tournament you wish to display.

### Integration Example

Here is a basic example of how to embed the bracket viewer using an HTML iframe:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://brackets.16tms.com/test-double-elimination" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### Live Demo

<iframe 
  src="https://brackets.16tms.com/test-double-elimination" 
  width="100%" 
  height="600px" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the bracket viewer to match your platform's branding.

1.  Log in to the **Console**.
2.  Navigate to **Tournaments** > **Select Tournament** > **Brackets**.
3.  Use the **Customize Bracket** options to adjust colors, themes, and other visual settings.

Changes made in the console will be reflected in the embedded viewer.
