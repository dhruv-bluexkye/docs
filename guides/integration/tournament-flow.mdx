# Tournament Flow

## Discovery
Use `GET /v1/tournaments` to list available tournaments. Filter by game, status, or date.

## Registration
1.  User clicks "Join".
2.  Client calls your backend.
3.  Your backend validates (e.g., checks balance).
4.  Your backend calls `POST /v1/tournaments/{id}/join`.

## Matchmaking
When the tournament starts, our system generates matches. Listen t webhook events `match.created` to notify users.

## Reporting
For manual games:
- Client calls `POST /v1/matches/{id}/report` with score.
For integrated games:
- Our server updates automatically.
