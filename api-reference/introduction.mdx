## Welcome to 16TMS API

The 16TMS API allows you to integrate tournament management functionality into your application. This API enables you to manage users, tournaments, participants, matches, and more.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.16tms.com/api/v1
```

For local development or testing, you may use your own server URL.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You need to include your API key in the request header.

### API Key Authentication

Include your API key in the `X-API-KEY` header with every request:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.16tms.com/api/v1/external/users' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: your-api-key' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Generate your API key from the [16TMS Console](https://console.16tms.com).
</Warning>

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": {
    // Response data
  },
  "meta": {
    "traceId": "unique-trace-id",
    "elapsedMs": 10.5,
    "serverTimestamp": "2026-02-09T06:07:53.9323654Z"
  }
}
```

### Response Fields

- **success**: Boolean indicating if the request was successful
- **message**: Human-readable message describing the result
- **data**: The actual response data (varies by endpoint)
- **meta**: Metadata about the request including trace ID, elapsed time, and server timestamp

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code along with error details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "fieldName",
      "message": "Specific error message"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "traceId": "unique-trace-id",
    "serverTimestamp": "2026-02-09T06:07:53.9323654Z"
  }
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

- **200**: Success
- **400**: Bad Request - Invalid input data
- **401**: Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key
- **404**: Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
- **500**: Internal Server Error
